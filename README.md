# Py[FV12](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/144.pdf)

Python implementation of Fan and Vercauterens ["Somewhat Practical Fully Homomorphic Encryption"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/144.pdf).

This implementation closely follows the paper. Theorems, Lemmas and Proofs were translated into tests. I avoided bit-shifting and other advanced techniques to keep the code as clean and comprehensible as possible.

**NOTE:** This implementation is for educational purposes only. 

## Usage

1. `pipenv install`
1. `pipenv shell`
1. `python main.py`
1. `python main.py tests`
